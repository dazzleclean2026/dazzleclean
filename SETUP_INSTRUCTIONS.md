# DAZZLE CLEAN - Setup Instructions

## ✅ Current Setup
- ✓ Tailwind CSS locally integrated (`tailwind_3_4_17.js`)
- ✓ All features configured
- ✓ Image placeholders ready

## 📸 Adding Images to Services Section

The website now supports images in the services cards. Each service card has an image area ready for your photos.

### Image Files Needed:
Place these image files in the same directory as `index.html`:

1. **house-cleaning.jpg** (for House Cleaning section)
   - Recommended size: 600x400px or similar
   - Format: JPG, PNG
   - Content: House interior, bathroom, kitchen cleaning

2. **car-cleaning.jpg** (for Car Cleaning section)
   - Recommended size: 600x400px or similar
   - Format: JPG, PNG
   - Content: Car washing, foam wash, detailing

3. **two-wheeler-cleaning.jpg** (for Two Wheeler Cleaning section)
   - Recommended size: 600x400px or similar
   - Format: JPG, PNG
   - Content: Bike/motorcycle washing and polishing

### How Images Work:
- The image areas are 600x400px on desktop (responsive)
- If an image file is missing, the emoji icon (🏠, 🚗, 🏍️) will show as fallback
- Images will scale responsively on all devices
- Border-radius: 12px (rounded corners)
